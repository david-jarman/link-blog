I use a lot of the mentioned strategies like prototyping as a learning mechanism, but still haven’t totally cracked the code on how to get unstuck other than time and random inspiration.<br><br>I think getting randomized is a huge source of demotivation for me and that’s not something you can always control. Best thing to do is block off your calendar and mute messages and emails from popping up, and checking those on an hourly basis. But also getting a random task to go learn about something might mean I lose all motivation for the current task and will slow down its completion by 10x or more.&nbsp;</div>	developers-block	2025-08-23 17:39:29.304643+00	f

I'm glad they were proactive about supporting it on day 1, but I also don't love that I have to trust that my hosting provider will add the support.<br><br>The bulk of the work for upgrading was figuring out where I have references to .NET 9 and replacing them, and then upgrading my Nuget packages. I also upgraded to Aspire 13 (not sure why they went from 9-&gt;13 version).<br><br>I only ran into one deprecated API (KnownNetworks in my forwarding middleware), but that was an easy fix (just use the new KnownIPNetworks property instead).<br><br>Seems like everything is still working. Hoping to dive more into the details of .NET 10 the next couple of weeks and give the blog some more love and updates. Maybe even add a search feature and proper paging for posts.</div>	dotnet-10	2025-11-12 06:55:54.740073+00	f

I have a wide array of interests and do not plan to focus this blog on any one particular topic. We'll see where this leads. The goal is not to build a following, be an "influencer" or "thought leader". I'd almost prefer if nobody reads this to be honest. <i>The goal is only to practice and improve my writing skills</i>. I will not use AI to write these posts, as that would go against the goal. I have no qualms with using AI and in fact use it all the time, but I will not improve my writing by having an LLM produce these posts for me.</p>\n\n<h3>// Interests</h3>\n<p>I have a wide variety of interests, and have been known to say that hobbies are my hobby. I <b>love</b> to try new things. There is nothing better than trying something new and seeing huge personal improvements. This blog is a good example, I've had a lot of fun writing the code for this website. The problem is that I also can lose interest quickly, but the following have been lifelong hobbies of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Riding bikes (all types of bikes), coding (wrote my first program in BASIC on a TI-89 in 2005), and music (playing and listening).</p>\n\n<p>Some hobbies have come and gone, such as beer brewing, running, cooking, and game dev, but each one has brought me valuable knowledge that I'm grateful for. If you ask anyone in my family, the apple doesn't fall from the tree. We once counted how many hobbies my dad has had over the years, I forget the exact number but it was over 20. Hobbies <b>are</b> my hobbies.</p>\n\n<h3>// Where you can find me</h3>\n<p>I don't post much anywhere else, but maybe that will change with this blog.</p>\n\n<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman">GitHub</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.threads.net/@david_jarman">Threads</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-jarman-31387131/">LinkedIn</a><br>	hello-world	2025-02-19 05:02:31.748579+00	f

Sometimes that feeling lasts all day and my productivity suffers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Solution:</b>Find ways to short-circuit those feelings. This requires introspection, which can be very difficult to do when you aren't feeling it. But sometimes, something happens in your day that you didn't expect, and it helps you short-circuit and get back on track.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>The number one thing for me that helps me get back on track is talking to people.</b></i> Find someone to have a conversation with, ideally someone who gives you energy and can make you laugh. Laughter and lively discussion can turn almost any bad day around for me. Find the people that give you joy, and give them a call. It's a better use of time than just sitting there, and when you are done, you may just have a good day.</p>\n\n<p>Be that person that gives others joy and energy on the days you are feeling it. Call your friends and family on good days, not just the bad ones.</p>	short-circuit	2025-02-19 20:05:40.623183+00	f

I was completely unaware of the term WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), but figured that embedding a rich-text editor into a website must be a <em>very&nbsp;</em>solved problem at this point. So I asked ChatGPT (first 4o, then o3-mini, then o1-pro) for advice on what I should do for this blog. I looked at a few options first, but so many projects are licensed under GPL2 or have weird pricing models. I needed the most bare-bones simple text editor that's totally free to use. That's when I found Trix.<br><br>I'm really liking is so far. I was able to integrate it into my Blazor admin page in about 5 minutes, including time figuring out how to make sure the binding of the content gets set up correctly. <a href="https://github.com/david-jarman/link-blog/commit/d747aa58bc3e7c6ad95052d8d27e270a710bd631">Here is the commit that shows the integration</a>.<br><br>In my testing, it's covered 90% of my use cases for styling in my writing. I think my only grip so far is that you can only insert an h1 heading. Probably not a huge deal, and I may be able to play around with Trix a bit more and figure out how to add a custom toolbar action to insert an h2 heading instead. Or maybe I can just style the h1 in the posts class to be a bit smaller. We'll see.<br><br>I have lots of other fun things I want to do with this blog, so it may fall by the way side. I also added an Atom feed to the site today, served at <a href="https://davidjarman.net/atom/all">https://davidjarman.net/atom/all</a>.</div>	trix-is-for-adults	2025-02-22 23:20:47.629586+00	f

This is always a temporary step. I don't actually check in the dependent code. I don't do it that often anymore, as you can enable debug options to disable "just my code" and if your dependencies publish symbols (most do in my experience), you can just F11 and step into library code from Nuget packages.<br><br>In the future, I may take up the vendoring approach for web frontends, where licenses allow. If nothing else, it gives me peace of mind that the dependency won't just disappear from the CDN.</div>	vendoring-essay	2025-02-24 20:11:38.50574+00	f

69b16f23-94d6-486d-b2d4-3f4c6696ccf1	Claude Code Initial Impressions	2025-02-24 21:36:53.288455+00	https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet	Claude Code Announcement	<div>Claude announced a new hybrid reasoning model today. That's a great idea to have a singular model for both reasoning and quick responses. <br><br>What I'm more interested in is their new Claude Code tool. It's an interactive CLI that is similar to GitHub Copilot or Cursor, but only runs in your terminal as of now. Here is the link for setting it up: <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview</a><br><br></div><div>I was hoping that this tool would just use my existing Claude plan, but no, of course you actually pay for the tokens it uses. I'm sure this was a very conscious decision, as this tool uses A LOT of tokens right now. I mean, it's breathtaking. The first thing I did was load it up on my link blog codebase, and ran the /init command to generate a readme file for the codebase. I immediately ran the /cost command to see how much that operation costed. Thirty cents. That may not sound like much, but for as small as my codebase is, I was expecting that to only be a few cents. I then gave it a very specific task to add validation to my admin post authoring form. I gave it a fair bit of instruction, as the docs recommends treating the tool like a software engineer that you would delegate a task to. So I gave it hints as to how to find validation rules and all that. I then sent it off. It ran for something like 2 minutes making the change. It prompted me for permission to perform tool actions (e.g. run some bash commands, run build, etc). After a total of 10 minutes of use, I was up to $1.50 in spend, the code did not build, and I realized that the <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26">tool call to build the code was broken</a>. <strong><em>Edit: It turns out powershell is not officially supported yet. You must use bash or zsh to launch claude.</em></strong><br><br>I'm still excited about this tool and will keep playing around with it. I'll probably have to reload my anthropic wallet with more credits soon as it is expensive, but so far it seems like a really cool concept, and I hope they keep improving it and driving down the cost.</div>	claude-code-initial-impressions	2025-02-24 22:23:53.411161+00	f

b2a38a28-d3c8-40a3-ac77-c5b904136e7a	.NET Aspire 9.1 just dropped	2025-02-27 04:40:22.39741+00	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/whats-new/dotnet-aspire-9.1	Release Notes	<div>I'm very excited about this release of .NET Aspire. It's an absolute game changer for me, specifically in doing dev work on this blog.<br><br></div><div>This release has a bunch of great stuff, but I'm actually only interested in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/7085">the bug fix</a> to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6704">this issue</a>. I really love the `dotnet watch run` command, which will perform a hot reload of your application when you make changes to the source files. Before this bug fix, sockets would not be freed up in a timely manner if the process ends, meaning that on reload, it would try to rebind to the existing ports and fail. This meant my workflow was 1. make a change 2. kill the running process 3. wait 10-15 seconds 4. run dotnet run again. Sometimes, I would have to rinse and repeat 3 and 4, if I hadn't waited long enough.<br><br>Now, I run `dotnet watch run`, make changes to my code (.cs, .css, and .razor files), and all I have to do to see the new changes is refresh my browser page. It's like magic. My dev loop has gone from ~30 seconds to see the changes reflected in the browser to near-instantly (the time it takes me to press F5 in Safari).<br><br>I've been very happy with .NET Aspire so far. But because I deploy to Heroku and not Azure, I can't take advantage of any of the deployment features. A side project I've been thinking about is to build a Heroku deployer based on a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/overview">.NET aspire deployment manifest</a>.</div>	net-aspire-9-1	2025-02-27 04:40:22.39741+00	f

I'm using Azure Storage accounts, as it's what I know, and I did not feel like diving into S3 buckets right now, although I probably should at some point.<br><br>Once again, .NET Aspire proved its usefulness. I kicked off the changes by adding the Azure Storage hosting and client integrations via Aspire, then added a Minimal API POST endpoint so I had a place to upload the images to. GitHub Copilot is very useful in these kinds of tasks. I can write a comment block describing what I want the endpoint to do, all the edge cases I think it should handle, then hit tab and get 90% of what I wanted. I go through and tweak the rest, then I'm testing almost immediately. <br><br>The last piece of the puzzle was hooking up my new endpoint to the Trix editor. Fortunately, the Trix dev team provided a nice Javascript file to show how to hook up the event listeners and use an XHR object to post the image back to the server. Considering my lack of experience with Javascript, I was ecstatic to get this working in only a few iterations.<br><br>I edited my last post to add a picture from my bike ride, so I know it's working, but I better add one to this post too :)<br><br><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:185777,&quot;height&quot;:697,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1110}" data-trix-content-type="image/jpeg" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Being a goofball with my Instax camera&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg"><a href="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg"><img src="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg" width="1110" height="697"><figcaption class="attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited">Being a goofball with my Instax camera</figcaption></a></figure></div>	introducing-images	2025-03-03 07:03:49.02425+00	f
16d39b46-91b0-44d2-9485-24da8fd1fe64	Back on the bike	2025-03-02 06:06:00.974705+00	https://www.strava.com/activities/13763450458	Strava Ride	<div>I broke my wrist back in January when I fell skiing down a run in the early season. Snow conditions were pretty bad and the moguls on the run had really built up. The resort really hadn't been able to groom the runs yet. I did the dumbest move possible and on my first run of the day decided to go down a black diamond. Classic move on my part.<br><br>I did a turn to go around a mogul and didn't realize how big a drop off there was. I lost balance and fell down it onto hard packed snow. I broke the fall with my left hand and immediately knew something was wrong, but did not consider that I broke anything... I got back up and continued to ski down. I did fall one other time but it was a typical lose-your-balance type fall. The only issue was getting back up, when I realized I couldn't put <em>any</em> weight onto my left hand. That's when I knew I was cooked. I managed to ski the rest of the way down to the bottom and found the nearest ski patrol. They put my hand in a splint and that's when I saw the massive swelling. I knew my day, if not season, was over.<br><br>The last two months have been tough, I had been really looking forward to skiing and getting better this season. I also haven't been able to bike much.

It can be used as a standalone CLI tool or as a python library. <br><br>I'm particularly interested in converting HTML to markdown, so that I can take public documentation online and convert it into a markdown file, which can be more effectively consumed by LLMs. I was playing around with this idea last week during a hackathon, where I wanted to take the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax?view=azure-devops">query language specification for WIQL</a> that is online and turn it into a compact prompt, so the LLM can more reliably create WIQL queries for me.<br><br></div><div>To get the HTML for the web page, I use Simon Willison's tool <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> to dump the HTML of the webpage, then pipe it into markitdown<br><br></div><pre>shot-scraper html https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax | markitdown &gt; wiql.md</pre><div>This produces a file called wiql.md (<a href="https://gist.github.com/david-jarman/256bb4f7c6b02fa982dba8d44cfbede2">link to gist with unmodified output</a>). It's certainly not perfect, the first 300 lines (out of around 1000), are not related to the documentation, and is just extra HTML that isn't needed. This could probably be mitigated by passing an element selector to shot-scraper, so it doesn't dump the unrelated HTML of the page. But it's not hard to delete those lines manually, and then the final result is pretty good. It looks fairly similar to the original web page.<br><br><em>edit: Here is the one-liner to only dump the relevant part of the page..

It really disoriented me, I had to stop what I was doing and ponder what was going on. Is reality breaking? Is the simulation throwing exceptions? Is the increase in compute usage in our world (due to increases in usage of AI and crypto) causing our host reality to lag out and add sprites in the wrong places? These are the thoughts that flooded my brain.<br><br>I've been thinking about that leaf for a while. I finally realized I live in the 21st century and can identity the leaf with my phone, and maybe that would offer a clue to my mystery. And yeah, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera">Common Ivy</a>, an evergreen plant. Mystery solved.<br><br>While this was a silly, and to me, quite funny little freak out, it has me wondering what things other people have stumbled across in the world that seemed so completely out of place, that it could only be by some non-natural means. I'm sure this happens to every one at some point in their lives.</div>	ontological-shock	2025-03-12 03:53:53.443317+00	f

My most recent template that I've been getting value out of is "<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman/llm-templates/blob/main/update-docs.yaml">update-docs</a>". I use this prompt/model combination to update documentation in my codebases after I've refactored code or added new functionality. The setup is that I use "files-to-prompt" to build the context of the codebase, including samples, then add a single markdown document that I want to be updated at the end. I've found that asking the AI to do too many things at once ends up with really bad results. I've also been playing around with different models. I haven't come to a conclusion on which is the absolute best for updating documentation, but so far o4-mini has given me better vibes than GPT 4.1.<br><br>Here is the one-liner command I use to update each document:<br><br></div><pre>files-to-prompt -c -e cs -e md -e csproj --ignore "bin*" --ignore "obj*" /path/to/code /path/to/samples /path/to/doc.md | llm -t gh:david-jarman/update-docs</pre><div>You can override the model in the llm call using "-m &lt;model&gt;"<br><br></div><pre>llm -t gh:david-jarman/update-docs -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</pre><div>The next thing I'd like to tackle is creating a fragment provider for this scenario so I don't have to add so many paths to files-to-prompt.

1ce27ff4-6c6d-4767-b937-151819242e2e	Staircase calculator	2025-05-16 15:38:34.25752+00	https://www.mycarpentry.com/stair-calculator.html	MyCarpentry	<div>I’ve been building a new staircase for the loft in my shop. This online calculator is the golden standard for calculating the rise/run of the stairs, stringer length, number of steps, etc. I love how well designed it is. It doesn’t look super fancy, but it works very well on mobile and desktop. Kudos to them for making an amazing resource with just the right amount of information to help people make safe staircases for themselves.<br><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;IMG_5421.jpeg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:635717,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/16/15/39/12/IMG_5421.png&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/16/15/39/12/IMG_5421.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:960}" data-trix-content-type="image/jpeg" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg"><a href="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/16/15/39/12/IMG_5421.png"><img src="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/16/15/39/12/IMG_5421.png" width="960" height="1280"><figcaption class="attachment__caption"><span class="attachment__name">IMG_5421.jpeg</span> <span class="attachment__size">620.82 KB</span></figcaption></a></figure>Edit: stairs are done<br><br><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;IMG_5428.jpeg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:586462,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/17/05/15/11/IMG_5428.png&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/17/05/15/11/IMG_5428.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:960}" data-trix-content-type="image/jpeg" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg"><a href="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/17/05/15/11/IMG_5428.png"><img src="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/05/17/05/15/11/IMG_5428.png" width="960" height="1280"><figcaption class="attachment__caption"><span class="attachment__name">IMG_5428.jpeg</span> <span class="attachment__size">572.72 KB</span></figcaption></a></figure></div>	staircase-calculator	2025-05-17 05:15:28.6378+00	f
60247833-9dc0-4962-907f-24bd60bcea99	Edit - a Windows-native CLI text editor	2025-05-19 19:18:36.612732+00	https://github.com/microsoft/edit	GitHub - Edit	<div>It's 2025, and I'm excited about a new CLI text editor. When I need a text editor in a shell, I always reach for vim, but I don't love it. It's there when I need it and serves its purpose, but I've never gotten over the weird key binding knowledge required just to exit and save a file.<br><br>What I like about Edit is that it's built as a TUI (Terminal User Interface) which means you can use your mouse (point and click), you can use ctrl+a to select all text, you can use ctrl+c and ctrl+v for copy paste, and it's just way more intuitive to use.<br><br></div><div><strong>Getting it to run</strong><br><br>The tool was just released, so as expected, there are some quirks. First and foremost, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit/issues/42">Windows Defenders think the pre-built binary the released is a virus</a>! In order to actually play with it, I had to build it from source using the rust tool chain.<br><br>Here's what I had to do:<br><br>Install the C++ toolchain using Visual Studio Installer.<br>Restart my shell, to update paths.<br><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install the rust toolchain</a><br>git clone https://github.com/microsoft/edit.git<br>rustup install nightly<br>rustup default nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (to set the nightly toolchain as the default)<br>rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (no idea why I had to do this, but rustup said I had to)<br>cargo build --config .cargo/release.toml --release (compile and linking step)<br>cp .\\target\\release\\edit.exe D:\\tools\\ (D:\\tools is where I store my adhoc tools that I build or maintain)<br><br>A few of these steps were documented on the Edit README.md file, but several were missing.</div>	edit-windows-cli	2025-05-19 19:18:36.612732+00	f
