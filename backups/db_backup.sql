I use a lot of the mentioned strategies like prototyping as a learning mechanism, but still haven’t totally cracked the code on how to get unstuck other than time and random inspiration.<br><br>I think getting randomized is a huge source of demotivation for me and that’s not something you can always control. Best thing to do is block off your calendar and mute messages and emails from popping up, and checking those on an hourly basis. But also getting a random task to go learn about something might mean I lose all motivation for the current task and will slow down its completion by 10x or more.&nbsp;</div>	developers-block	2025-08-23 17:39:29.304643+00	f

I'm glad they were proactive about supporting it on day 1, but I also don't love that I have to trust that my hosting provider will add the support.<br><br>The bulk of the work for upgrading was figuring out where I have references to .NET 9 and replacing them, and then upgrading my Nuget packages. I also upgraded to Aspire 13 (not sure why they went from 9-&gt;13 version).<br><br>I only ran into one deprecated API (KnownNetworks in my forwarding middleware), but that was an easy fix (just use the new KnownIPNetworks property instead).<br><br>Seems like everything is still working. Hoping to dive more into the details of .NET 10 the next couple of weeks and give the blog some more love and updates. Maybe even add a search feature and proper paging for posts.</div>	dotnet-10	2025-11-12 06:55:54.740073+00	f

I have a wide array of interests and do not plan to focus this blog on any one particular topic. We'll see where this leads. The goal is not to build a following, be an "influencer" or "thought leader". I'd almost prefer if nobody reads this to be honest. <i>The goal is only to practice and improve my writing skills</i>. I will not use AI to write these posts, as that would go against the goal. I have no qualms with using AI and in fact use it all the time, but I will not improve my writing by having an LLM produce these posts for me.</p>\n\n<h3>// Interests</h3>\n<p>I have a wide variety of interests, and have been known to say that hobbies are my hobby. I <b>love</b> to try new things. There is nothing better than trying something new and seeing huge personal improvements. This blog is a good example, I've had a lot of fun writing the code for this website. The problem is that I also can lose interest quickly, but the following have been lifelong hobbies of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Riding bikes (all types of bikes), coding (wrote my first program in BASIC on a TI-89 in 2005), and music (playing and listening).</p>\n\n<p>Some hobbies have come and gone, such as beer brewing, running, cooking, and game dev, but each one has brought me valuable knowledge that I'm grateful for. If you ask anyone in my family, the apple doesn't fall from the tree. We once counted how many hobbies my dad has had over the years, I forget the exact number but it was over 20. Hobbies <b>are</b> my hobbies.</p>\n\n<h3>// Where you can find me</h3>\n<p>I don't post much anywhere else, but maybe that will change with this blog.</p>\n\n<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman">GitHub</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.threads.net/@david_jarman">Threads</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-jarman-31387131/">LinkedIn</a><br>	hello-world	2025-02-19 05:02:31.748579+00	f

Sometimes that feeling lasts all day and my productivity suffers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Solution:</b>Find ways to short-circuit those feelings. This requires introspection, which can be very difficult to do when you aren't feeling it. But sometimes, something happens in your day that you didn't expect, and it helps you short-circuit and get back on track.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>The number one thing for me that helps me get back on track is talking to people.</b></i> Find someone to have a conversation with, ideally someone who gives you energy and can make you laugh. Laughter and lively discussion can turn almost any bad day around for me. Find the people that give you joy, and give them a call. It's a better use of time than just sitting there, and when you are done, you may just have a good day.</p>\n\n<p>Be that person that gives others joy and energy on the days you are feeling it. Call your friends and family on good days, not just the bad ones.</p>	short-circuit	2025-02-19 20:05:40.623183+00	f

I was completely unaware of the term WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), but figured that embedding a rich-text editor into a website must be a <em>very&nbsp;</em>solved problem at this point. So I asked ChatGPT (first 4o, then o3-mini, then o1-pro) for advice on what I should do for this blog. I looked at a few options first, but so many projects are licensed under GPL2 or have weird pricing models. I needed the most bare-bones simple text editor that's totally free to use. That's when I found Trix.<br><br>I'm really liking is so far. I was able to integrate it into my Blazor admin page in about 5 minutes, including time figuring out how to make sure the binding of the content gets set up correctly. <a href="https://github.com/david-jarman/link-blog/commit/d747aa58bc3e7c6ad95052d8d27e270a710bd631">Here is the commit that shows the integration</a>.<br><br>In my testing, it's covered 90% of my use cases for styling in my writing. I think my only grip so far is that you can only insert an h1 heading. Probably not a huge deal, and I may be able to play around with Trix a bit more and figure out how to add a custom toolbar action to insert an h2 heading instead. Or maybe I can just style the h1 in the posts class to be a bit smaller. We'll see.<br><br>I have lots of other fun things I want to do with this blog, so it may fall by the way side. I also added an Atom feed to the site today, served at <a href="https://davidjarman.net/atom/all">https://davidjarman.net/atom/all</a>.</div>	trix-is-for-adults	2025-02-22 23:20:47.629586+00	f

This is always a temporary step. I don't actually check in the dependent code. I don't do it that often anymore, as you can enable debug options to disable "just my code" and if your dependencies publish symbols (most do in my experience), you can just F11 and step into library code from Nuget packages.<br><br>In the future, I may take up the vendoring approach for web frontends, where licenses allow. If nothing else, it gives me peace of mind that the dependency won't just disappear from the CDN.</div>	vendoring-essay	2025-02-24 20:11:38.50574+00	f

69b16f23-94d6-486d-b2d4-3f4c6696ccf1	Claude Code Initial Impressions	2025-02-24 21:36:53.288455+00	https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet	Claude Code Announcement	<div>Claude announced a new hybrid reasoning model today. That's a great idea to have a singular model for both reasoning and quick responses. <br><br>What I'm more interested in is their new Claude Code tool. It's an interactive CLI that is similar to GitHub Copilot or Cursor, but only runs in your terminal as of now. Here is the link for setting it up: <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview</a><br><br></div><div>I was hoping that this tool would just use my existing Claude plan, but no, of course you actually pay for the tokens it uses. I'm sure this was a very conscious decision, as this tool uses A LOT of tokens right now. I mean, it's breathtaking. The first thing I did was load it up on my link blog codebase, and ran the /init command to generate a readme file for the codebase. I immediately ran the /cost command to see how much that operation costed. Thirty cents. That may not sound like much, but for as small as my codebase is, I was expecting that to only be a few cents. I then gave it a very specific task to add validation to my admin post authoring form. I gave it a fair bit of instruction, as the docs recommends treating the tool like a software engineer that you would delegate a task to. So I gave it hints as to how to find validation rules and all that. I then sent it off. It ran for something like 2 minutes making the change. It prompted me for permission to perform tool actions (e.g. run some bash commands, run build, etc). After a total of 10 minutes of use, I was up to $1.50 in spend, the code did not build, and I realized that the <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26">tool call to build the code was broken</a>. <strong><em>Edit: It turns out powershell is not officially supported yet. You must use bash or zsh to launch claude.</em></strong><br><br>I'm still excited about this tool and will keep playing around with it. I'll probably have to reload my anthropic wallet with more credits soon as it is expensive, but so far it seems like a really cool concept, and I hope they keep improving it and driving down the cost.</div>	claude-code-initial-impressions	2025-02-24 22:23:53.411161+00	f

b2a38a28-d3c8-40a3-ac77-c5b904136e7a	.NET Aspire 9.1 just dropped	2025-02-27 04:40:22.39741+00	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/whats-new/dotnet-aspire-9.1	Release Notes	<div>I'm very excited about this release of .NET Aspire. It's an absolute game changer for me, specifically in doing dev work on this blog.<br><br></div><div>This release has a bunch of great stuff, but I'm actually only interested in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/7085">the bug fix</a> to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6704">this issue</a>. I really love the `dotnet watch run` command, which will perform a hot reload of your application when you make changes to the source files. Before this bug fix, sockets would not be freed up in a timely manner if the process ends, meaning that on reload, it would try to rebind to the existing ports and fail. This meant my workflow was 1. make a change 2. kill the running process 3. wait 10-15 seconds 4. run dotnet run again. Sometimes, I would have to rinse and repeat 3 and 4, if I hadn't waited long enough.<br><br>Now, I run `dotnet watch run`, make changes to my code (.cs, .css, and .razor files), and all I have to do to see the new changes is refresh my browser page. It's like magic. My dev loop has gone from ~30 seconds to see the changes reflected in the browser to near-instantly (the time it takes me to press F5 in Safari).<br><br>I've been very happy with .NET Aspire so far. But because I deploy to Heroku and not Azure, I can't take advantage of any of the deployment features. A side project I've been thinking about is to build a Heroku deployer based on a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/overview">.NET aspire deployment manifest</a>.</div>	net-aspire-9-1	2025-02-27 04:40:22.39741+00	f

I'm using Azure Storage accounts, as it's what I know, and I did not feel like diving into S3 buckets right now, although I probably should at some point.<br><br>Once again, .NET Aspire proved its usefulness. I kicked off the changes by adding the Azure Storage hosting and client integrations via Aspire, then added a Minimal API POST endpoint so I had a place to upload the images to. GitHub Copilot is very useful in these kinds of tasks. I can write a comment block describing what I want the endpoint to do, all the edge cases I think it should handle, then hit tab and get 90% of what I wanted. I go through and tweak the rest, then I'm testing almost immediately. <br><br>The last piece of the puzzle was hooking up my new endpoint to the Trix editor. Fortunately, the Trix dev team provided a nice Javascript file to show how to hook up the event listeners and use an XHR object to post the image back to the server. Considering my lack of experience with Javascript, I was ecstatic to get this working in only a few iterations.<br><br>I edited my last post to add a picture from my bike ride, so I know it's working, but I better add one to this post too :)<br><br><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:185777,&quot;height&quot;:697,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1110}" data-trix-content-type="image/jpeg" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Being a goofball with my Instax camera&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg"><a href="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg"><img src="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2025/03/03/07/01/49/2025012600044699778.jpeg" width="1110" height="697"><figcaption class="attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited">Being a goofball with my Instax camera</figcaption></a></figure></div>	introducing-images	2025-03-03 07:03:49.02425+00	f
16d39b46-91b0-44d2-9485-24da8fd1fe64	Back on the bike	2025-03-02 06:06:00.974705+00	https://www.strava.com/activities/13763450458	Strava Ride	<div>I broke my wrist back in January when I fell skiing down a run in the early season. Snow conditions were pretty bad and the moguls on the run had really built up. The resort really hadn't been able to groom the runs yet. I did the dumbest move possible and on my first run of the day decided to go down a black diamond. Classic move on my part.<br><br>I did a turn to go around a mogul and didn't realize how big a drop off there was. I lost balance and fell down it onto hard packed snow. I broke the fall with my left hand and immediately knew something was wrong, but did not consider that I broke anything... I got back up and continued to ski down. I did fall one other time but it was a typical lose-your-balance type fall. The only issue was getting back up, when I realized I couldn't put <em>any</em> weight onto my left hand. That's when I knew I was cooked. I managed to ski the rest of the way down to the bottom and found the nearest ski patrol. They put my hand in a splint and that's when I saw the massive swelling. I knew my day, if not season, was over.<br><br>The last two months have been tough, I had been really looking forward to skiing and getting better this season. I also haven't been able to bike much.

It can be used as a standalone CLI tool or as a python library. <br><br>I'm particularly interested in converting HTML to markdown, so that I can take public documentation online and convert it into a markdown file, which can be more effectively consumed by LLMs. I was playing around with this idea last week during a hackathon, where I wanted to take the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax?view=azure-devops">query language specification for WIQL</a> that is online and turn it into a compact prompt, so the LLM can more reliably create WIQL queries for me.<br><br></div><div>To get the HTML for the web page, I use Simon Willison's tool <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> to dump the HTML of the webpage, then pipe it into markitdown<br><br></div><pre>shot-scraper html https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax | markitdown &gt; wiql.md</pre><div>This produces a file called wiql.md (<a href="https://gist.github.com/david-jarman/256bb4f7c6b02fa982dba8d44cfbede2">link to gist with unmodified output</a>). It's certainly not perfect, the first 300 lines (out of around 1000), are not related to the documentation, and is just extra HTML that isn't needed. This could probably be mitigated by passing an element selector to shot-scraper, so it doesn't dump the unrelated HTML of the page. But it's not hard to delete those lines manually, and then the final result is pretty good. It looks fairly similar to the original web page.<br><br><em>edit: Here is the one-liner to only dump the relevant part of the page..

It really disoriented me, I had to stop what I was doing and ponder what was going on. Is reality breaking? Is the simulation throwing exceptions? Is the increase in compute usage in our world (due to increases in usage of AI and crypto) causing our host reality to lag out and add sprites in the wrong places? These are the thoughts that flooded my brain.<br><br>I've been thinking about that leaf for a while. I finally realized I live in the 21st century and can identity the leaf with my phone, and maybe that would offer a clue to my mystery. And yeah, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera">Common Ivy</a>, an evergreen plant. Mystery solved.<br><br>While this was a silly, and to me, quite funny little freak out, it has me wondering what things other people have stumbled across in the world that seemed so completely out of place, that it could only be by some non-natural means. I'm sure this happens to every one at some point in their lives.</div>	ontological-shock	2025-03-12 03:53:53.443317+00	f

My most recent template that I've been getting value out of is "<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman/llm-templates/blob/main/update-docs.yaml">update-docs</a>". I use this prompt/model combination to update documentation in my codebases after I've refactored code or added new functionality. The setup is that I use "files-to-prompt" to build the context of the codebase, including samples, then add a single markdown document that I want to be updated at the end. I've found that asking the AI to do too many things at once ends up with really bad results. I've also been playing around with different models. I haven't come to a conclusion on which is the absolute best for updating documentation, but so far o4-mini has given me better vibes than GPT 4.1.<br><br>Here is the one-liner command I use to update each document:<br><br></div><pre>files-to-prompt -c -e cs -e md -e csproj --ignore "bin*" --ignore "obj*" /path/to/code /path/to/samples /path/to/doc.md | llm -t gh:david-jarman/update-docs</pre><div>You can override the model in the llm call using "-m &lt;model&gt;"<br><br></div><pre>llm -t gh:david-jarman/update-docs -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</pre><div>The next thing I'd like to tackle is creating a fragment provider for this scenario so I don't have to add so many paths to files-to-prompt.

I even started taking guitar lessons. My practice has involved playing a lot of bluegrass fiddle tunes and learning carter-style arrangements of old country and bluegrass songs.<br><br>Playing bluegrass with others involves playing solos, or "taking breaks". This just means improvising over the melody of the song. As I've been inching closer toward working on my own improvisational skills, I've realized that I don't have as much intuition about what each interval in the chromatic scale truly sounds like. I want to get to the point where I can listen to a song and recognize when the 4th chord is played vs the 5th or in a break when someone adds in a flat 5.&nbsp;<br><br>To help myself train my ear to recognize each interval, I vibe coded a tool using Claude code. The page has two main parts: play each interval at your own pace and a quiz that will play intervals at random and you have to choose the correct one. I also added some descriptions to the intervals to help myself think about what those intervals feel like. There is also a toggle to show the "blue notes".&nbsp;<br><br>This is one part of my journey to being able to both improvise better but also transcribe music faster.</div>	music-theory-interval-trainer	2025-12-14 04:08:55.693974+00	f

Fortunately there is a handy dotnet tool that will report and update packages that are out of date. I used this to update all the packages in the link-blog source code this evening and was pleasantly surprised it just worked. Only issue I found was that because I create a msbuild property to store the OpenTelemetry version (there are three OTel packages with the same version), the tool updated the PackageVersions directly instead of just updating the property. Not a big deal, and I would have been shocked if it was able to handle a corner case like that.<br><br>Now I need to see if I can get this to run as a daily CI task.</div>	dotnet-outdated-tool	2025-12-17 04:08:04.298497+00	f
73659e3e-2d64-4df0-99be-937ba99269e6	FYI: Automatically apply EF core migrations in Aspire	2025-12-18 05:58:27.464932+00	https://aspire.dev/integrations/databases/efcore/migrations/	Apply EF Core migrations in Aspire	<div>If you are using Aspire and EF core to manage the schema of your database, this documentation is a great starting place to make the two work together.<br><br>The core concept is that you add a worker service that is dedicated to running migrations, creating the initial database, and seeding data to the database. Essentially any operation that should be performed before the actual web app starts up. I implemented this in the blog this evening with the help of Claude Code while I watched Twin Peaks.<br><br>One prerequisite was that I had to move my DbContext and Entity classes to a shared library so that the web app and worker services could both access them. I had actually tried to do this when I first created the blog but ran into issues and decided to simplify the design. I first told Claude to separate out the database entities, migrations, and contexts to a separate project. I was surprised how long this actually took. But in the end, something like 20+ files were touched, but all tests passed and the changes looked good.<br><br>Next, I started a new chat with Claude (/new command), and gave it the same link provided in this post.<br><br></div><blockquote>Follow the instructions at the following url to automatically apply migrations when running locally: https://aspire.dev/integrations/databases/efcore/migrations/</blockquote><div>It then proceeded to one-shot the changes and everything just worked.

The music is linked to cards that you insert to the player. The cards don't hold any actual data are instead just an NFC chip that tells the player what music and artwork to download and play. It's a clever little device and I really like it so far. Another great feature is that you can create custom cards from MP3s and your own pixel artwork. <br><br>My daughter is obsessed with Marty Robbins "Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs". It's a really great album that we listen to on vinyl all the time. So my first task on Christmas was to load a custom card with the album and make some custom artwork.

What if each program like notepad, paint, or task manager were priced this way? Or worse you had to pay a subscription! I’m actually shocked we didn’t end up in this world. Thankfully nerds write software for the love of the game and give it away. This puts downward pressure on the bugs corps to not nickel and dime software. All that said, I’m happy the file pilot dev values their own work and has priced this tool accordingly. If nothing else, I think it shows the windows team how software should run (fast) with few dependencies.<br><br><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;IMG_7526.jpeg&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:364870,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2026/01/08/03/42/23/IMG_7526.png&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2026/01/08/03/42/23/IMG_7526.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1080}" data-trix-content-type="image/jpeg" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Screenshot&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--jpeg"><a href="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2026/01/08/03/42/23/IMG_7526.png"><img src="https://linkblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2026/01/08/03/42/23/IMG_7526.png" width="1080" height="1080"><figcaption class="attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited">Screenshot</figcaption></a></figure></div>	file-pilot	2026-01-08 15:06:20.799052+00	f
a03b9d1e-b45c-416c-b26b-3fdc24c9f240	Get notifications from Claude Code on Windows with WSL	2026-01-09 23:31:51.453445+00	https://gist.github.com/david-jarman/27d6eec0ec0114f545d5dff84152a9ed	My ~/.claude/settings.json with full solution	<div>I've been looking for a way to get notified when Claude Code needs my input or is finished. Big shout out to u/Ok-Engineering2612 on Reddit for this post:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1m2qscz/wsl_toast_notifications_with_hooks_in_claude_code/">WSL Toast Notifications with Hooks in Claude Code : r/ClaudeAI</a>. I had been trying to do the same thing with BurntToast but I forget the way WSL interops with Windows.<br><br>The settings from the Reddit thread did need a little tweaking ($PAYLOAD is no longer supported and now Claude Code sends the JSON structure via stdin). Here's my change to the command:<br><br></div><pre> "command": "input=$(cat) &amp;&amp; powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \\"Import-Module BurntToast; New-BurntToastNotification -Text 'Claude Code Notification', '$(echo \\"$input\\" | jq -r '.message')'\\""</pre><div>Here is the full documentation for hooks:&nbsp;<a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#notification-input">Hooks reference</a></div>	claude-code-notifications-wsl	2026-01-09 23:36:56.409433+00	f
