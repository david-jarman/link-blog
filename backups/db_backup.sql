This is how I know I‚Äôm getting old. The music is timeless though. </p>\n\n<p>Other notable artists this week: Ethel Cain and Kendrick Lamar. I need to find some new music asap. </p>	music-of-the-week
7942ca49-82ef-411c-8f5a-4c0a65855116	A Place to Call Home	2025-02-19 05:02:31.748579+00			<p>Hey, my name is David Jarman.</p>\n\n<h3>// Intent</h3>\n<p>I'm starting this blog to create a space of my own on the web. I have a wide array of interests and do not plan to focus this blog on any one particular topic. We'll see where this leads. The goal is not to build a following, be an "influencer" or "thought leader". I'd almost prefer if nobody reads this to be honest. <i>The goal is only to practice and improve my writing skills</i>. I will not use AI to write these posts, as that would go against the goal. I have no qualms with using AI and in fact use it all the time, but I will not improve my writing by having an LLM produce these posts for me.</p>\n\n<h3>// Interests</h3>\n<p>I have a wide variety of interests, and have been known to say that hobbies are my hobby. I <b>love</b> to try new things. There is nothing better than trying something new and seeing huge personal improvements. This blog is a good example, I've had a lot of fun writing the code for this website. The problem is that I also can lose interest quickly, but the following have been lifelong hobbies of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Riding bikes (all types of bikes), coding (wrote my first program in BASIC on a TI-89 in 2005), and music (playing and listening).</p>\n\n<p>Some hobbies have come and gone, such as beer brewing, running, cooking, and game dev, but each one has brought me valuable knowledge that I'm grateful for. If you ask anyone in my family, the apple doesn't fall from the tree. We once counted how many hobbies my dad has had over the years, I forget the exact number but it was over 20. Hobbies <b>are</b> my hobbies.</p>\n\n<h3>// Where you can find me</h3>\n<p>I don't post much anywhere else, but maybe that will change with this blog.</p>\n\n<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman">GitHub</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.threads.net/@david_jarman">Threads</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-jarman-31387131/">LinkedIn</a><br>	hello-world
c8f0e743-50f9-4bc1-8689-66ec6076155c	Short-circuiting to get back on track	2025-02-19 20:05:40.623183+00			<p><b>Problem:</b> Sometimes I start out my day at work not feeling it. Sometimes that feeling lasts all day and my productivity suffers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Solution:</b>Find ways to short-circuit those feelings. This requires introspection, which can be very difficult to do when you aren't feeling it. But sometimes, something happens in your day that you didn't expect, and it helps you short-circuit and get back on track.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>The number one thing for me that helps me get back on track is talking to people.</b></i> Find someone to have a conversation with, ideally someone who gives you energy and can make you laugh. Laughter and lively discussion can turn almost any bad day around for me. Find the people that give you joy, and give them a call. It's a better use of time than just sitting there, and when you are done, you may just have a good day.</p>\n\n<p>Be that person that gives others joy and energy on the days you are feeling it. Call your friends and family on good days, not just the bad ones.</p>	short-circuit

f25dd03e-2770-41db-a9e6-cd904f6ea935	Adding the Trix editor to my Blazor SSR site	2025-02-22 23:20:47.629586+00	https://trix-editor.org	Trix: Rich Editor	<div><strong><em>Reinventing a blog website is so fun<br><br></em></strong>I've been raw-dogging these posts thus far, manually typing HTML elements into a raw textarea in my admin page so I get something that looks halfway decent.<br><br>I decided it was time to upgrade my post editing experience. I was completely unaware of the term WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), but figured that embedding a rich-text editor into a website must be a <em>very&nbsp;</em>solved problem at this point. So I asked ChatGPT (first 4o, then o3-mini, then o1-pro) for advice on what I should do for this blog. I looked at a few options first, but so many projects are licensed under GPL2 or have weird pricing models. I needed the most bare-bones simple text editor that's totally free to use. That's when I found Trix.<br><br>I'm really liking is so far. I was able to integrate it into my Blazor admin page in about 5 minutes, including time figuring out how to make sure the binding of the content gets set up correctly. <a href="https://github.com/david-jarman/link-blog/commit/d747aa58bc3e7c6ad95052d8d27e270a710bd631">Here is the commit that shows the integration</a>.<br><br>In my testing, it's covered 90% of my use cases for styling in my writing. I think my only grip so far is that you can only insert an h1 heading. Probably not a huge deal, and I may be able to play around with Trix a bit more and figure out how to add a custom toolbar action to insert an h2 heading instead. Or maybe I can just style the h1 in the posts class to be a bit smaller. We'll see.<br><br>I have lots of other fun things I want to do with this blog, so it may fall by the way side. I also added an Atom feed to the site today, served at <a href="https://davidjarman.net/atom/all">https://davidjarman.net/atom/all</a>.</div>	trix-is-for-adults

Going forward I think it will become my main driver.<br><br>Only con I can think of is it does take a while longer to cook.&nbsp;</div>	brown-rice
