This is how I know I‚Äôm getting old. The music is timeless though. </p>\n\n<p>Other notable artists this week: Ethel Cain and Kendrick Lamar. I need to find some new music asap. </p>	music-of-the-week

I have a wide array of interests and do not plan to focus this blog on any one particular topic. We'll see where this leads. The goal is not to build a following, be an "influencer" or "thought leader". I'd almost prefer if nobody reads this to be honest. <i>The goal is only to practice and improve my writing skills</i>. I will not use AI to write these posts, as that would go against the goal. I have no qualms with using AI and in fact use it all the time, but I will not improve my writing by having an LLM produce these posts for me.</p>\n\n<h3>// Interests</h3>\n<p>I have a wide variety of interests, and have been known to say that hobbies are my hobby. I <b>love</b> to try new things. There is nothing better than trying something new and seeing huge personal improvements. This blog is a good example, I've had a lot of fun writing the code for this website. The problem is that I also can lose interest quickly, but the following have been lifelong hobbies of mine:</p>\n\n<p>Riding bikes (all types of bikes), coding (wrote my first program in BASIC on a TI-89 in 2005), and music (playing and listening).</p>\n\n<p>Some hobbies have come and gone, such as beer brewing, running, cooking, and game dev, but each one has brought me valuable knowledge that I'm grateful for. If you ask anyone in my family, the apple doesn't fall from the tree. We once counted how many hobbies my dad has had over the years, I forget the exact number but it was over 20. Hobbies <b>are</b> my hobbies.</p>\n\n<h3>// Where you can find me</h3>\n<p>I don't post much anywhere else, but maybe that will change with this blog.</p>\n\n<a href="https://github.com/david-jarman">GitHub</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.threads.net/@david_jarman">Threads</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-jarman-31387131/">LinkedIn</a><br>	hello-world
c8f0e743-50f9-4bc1-8689-66ec6076155c	Short-circuiting to get back on track	2025-02-19 20:05:40.623183+00			<p><b>Problem:</b> Sometimes I start out my day at work not feeling it. Sometimes that feeling lasts all day and my productivity suffers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Solution:</b>Find ways to short-circuit those feelings. This requires introspection, which can be very difficult to do when you aren't feeling it. But sometimes, something happens in your day that you didn't expect, and it helps you short-circuit and get back on track.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>The number one thing for me that helps me get back on track is talking to people.</b></i> Find someone to have a conversation with, ideally someone who gives you energy and can make you laugh. Laughter and lively discussion can turn almost any bad day around for me. Find the people that give you joy, and give them a call. It's a better use of time than just sitting there, and when you are done, you may just have a good day.</p>\n\n<p>Be that person that gives others joy and energy on the days you are feeling it. Call your friends and family on good days, not just the bad ones.</p>	short-circuit
